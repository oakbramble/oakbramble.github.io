<h2>Fantasy improviser, game master and fitness trainer</h2>

<p>
After training and performing improv theatre for some years, I discovered table top role playing games at the start of 2020. I would say it was love at first roll, but even before my first game I knew RPGs were for me.
</p>
<p>
I jumped straight into game mastering and now run a combination of D&D campaigns and public <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pen-and-paper-berlin/">meetups</a> for totally improvised one shots (mostly based on one page games from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/gshowitt">Grant Howitt</a>).
</p>
<p>
In autumn 2023 I will start running a group that meets to build improv muscles for RPG players and GMs.

<p>
My love of performing and energising groups is also given an outlet in my work as a <a href="https://www.lesmills.com/uk/workouts/group-fitness/bodypump/">group fitness trainer</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Having had very negative encounters with sport as a child and in school, I would never have imagined being in this position. However with the joy and strength I now feel from powering through workouts, and the very tangible changes that have followed in body and mind, I now firmly believe that anyone can get fit at any age and, importantly, that everyone is <i>allowed</i> to get fit. Sport is not just for those who were sporty at school.

I have also worked on many other creative projects, including writing and singing <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-337492149-39167730">The Unreal Book</a>.
